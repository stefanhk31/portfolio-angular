Stefan is a great communicator and his extensive background in academe meant he was able to assess our needs, to incorporate our feedback as the designs developed, and to put together the website we needed. Months later our project grew and our team expanded to include a full-time group of developers from the Stanford Libraries. Stefan’s initial website served as a wonderful starting point for their development of the final static webpages. The combination of Stefan’s technical and interpersonal skills makes him a great addition to any project team.\" -Michael Penn, Stanford University",
