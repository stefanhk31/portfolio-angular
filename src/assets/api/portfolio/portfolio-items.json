        "project": "WhereToDo is a location-based todo list. Users enter a task, location, and address, and a pin pops up on the map marking that particular task location. If there are multiple tasks in the same location, they will be combined into the same list. Users can then filter which lists appear on the map based on location name or distance from their current position.",
        "tech": "The app is built with React, using create-react-app. The map and distance filter come from Mapbox, and geolocation relies on HERE. Using these services was a great opportunity for me to learn how to build API services into my apps.",
        "future": "There are a few UI additions that would improve WhereToDo, including descriptive popups for the map pins, and a collapsible list panel for mobile. Functionally, I would like to add backend data storage, to allow users to store lists when they navigate away from the page. Iâ€™d also like to make WhereToDo into a Native app, in order to provide better mobile performance."
